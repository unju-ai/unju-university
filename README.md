## FAQ

**Q: Is this a scam?**  
A: No. Build real things, learn real skills. Refund if you don't ship anything.

**Q: Can I get a refund?**  
A: Yes, if you complete the work but don't feel you got value. We're confident you will.

**Q: Do I need to know how to code?**  
A: Basic programming helps, but we'll teach you. More important: can you figure things out?

**Q: Are the AI teachers actually helpful?**  
A: Yes. They're specialized agents trained on the material. Available 24/7. Better than Stack Overflow.

**Q: What if I fail?**  
A: You don't. You either ship or you learn. Both are wins.

**Q: Can I take multiple tracks?**  
A: Yes! Most people do 2-3 tracks. Jack of all trades > master of one in Web3.

**Q: Is this accredited?**  
A: No. Credentials don't matter. Your GitHub does.

**Q: Can I teach a course?**  
A: Yes! Proven builders can create courses. Reach out.

**Q: What's the time commitment?**  
A: Level 1: 10 hrs/week. Level 2: 15 hrs/week. Level 3: 20+ hrs/week. This is serious.

**Q: Can I do this part-time?**  
A: Yes, but results will be slower. Most successful students go full-time.
